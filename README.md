# python-exercise

This consists of two exercises using python. 

This game can be run as a shell script from the command line using the command 'python firstpython.py'. The only pre requisite is that python must be installed, and it can be installed from this website: https://www.python.org/downloads/

The first exercise calculates in which year you will reach 100. It does this by subtracting the inputted age from the current year, adding a hundred and then returning the year. 

The second exercise allows the user to input a number and it will tell you if it is odd or even by using the modulo operator to check if the number is even, and then printing the result.
